# Kill-the-Trolls
A simple text-based game. Hero against Trolls.

The game begins by setting the health and damage levels, setting the amount of trolls and then if there are too many of the blighters, giving you a small amount of bonus health.

You have 2 attacks, Sword and Iron Fist. 

Sword will do between 1 and 5 damage, where Iron Fist deals between 2 and 4 damage.

On each attack, the troll will counter attack dealing between 0 and 3 damage. (You're right, I could put that the attack misses instead of saying that the troll deals 0 damage)

That's about it, fight until either you die or you rise victoriously over the trolls!
